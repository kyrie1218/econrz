  abstract = {Economic investments in children may represent a powerful mechanism to explain differences in child outcomes across family types. Unfortunately, evidence on child-related spending across family structures remains poorly understood. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (1996–2015), this study is the first to investigate patterns of child-related spending in an increasingly common type of extended family household: multigenerational households, in which children reside with at least one parent and grandparent. This study also contributes to a growing literature giving primacy to parents' socioeconomic disadvantage as moderating the association between multigenerational relationships and child well-being. Results indicate that, when compared to similar two-generation households, multigenerational households are associated with increased spending on education and with decreased spending on child care. Differences in child-related spending between multigenerational and two-generation households differ according to parents' income and relationship status. Overall, living with grandparents represents an adaptive strategy that helps low-income or single parents invest more money in their children's education, hobbies and activities, and to save on the costs of child care.},

  abstract = {Grandparents at working age frequently take care of their grandchildren. These time transfers may constrain the formal labor supply of grandparents. Using an instrumental variable strategy and multiple waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we estimate the causal effect of grandparenthood on the labor supply of working-age grandparents in ten European countries. We find a large negative impact of grandparenthood on the employment rate of women aged 55 to 64. The effect is particularly pronounced in countries where the availability of formal childcare is low. A complier characterization reveals that the large LATE applies to a small but not selected group of potential grandmothers and may explain a substantial share of the gender gap in employment at later working age. Male labor supply does not significantly adjust in response to grandparenthood. We further find that grandmothers are more likely to transfer gifts to their children than women who are not grandmothers, whereby grandmothers substitute between time and gift transfers.},

The data are available to the scientific community free of charge at www.shareproject.org after registration. SHARE is harmonized with the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and has become a role model for several ageing surveys worldwide. SHARE’s scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process, its multidisciplinary approach that delivers the full picture of individual and societal ageing, and its cross-nationally ex-ante harmonized design that permits international comparisons of health, economic and social outcomes in Europe and the USA.},

Our analysis shows that, among the women studied, those whose own mothers are retirement eligible have a 11\% higher probability of being in the labor force than those whose mothers are ineligible. The pension eligibility of maternal grandfathers and paternal grandparents, however, has no significant effect on the women’s labor force participation. We also demonstrate that the eligibility of maternal grandmothers mainly captures the effect of their availability for childcare. Hence, pension reforms, by potentially robbing households of an important source of flexible, low-cost childcare, could have unintended negative consequences for the employment rates of women with young children.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To provide an overview of the prevalence and profiles of grandparents providing childcare to grandchildren in 2 East asian countries, China and south Korea, characterized by similar demographic developments and a shared cultural background but having very different contemporary institutional and socioeconomic circumstances. Method. We apply logistic models to analyze pilot data from the China Health and retirement longitudinal study (CHarls) and data from the Korean longitudinal study of aging (Klosa; Wave 2). Our analytic sample comprises 772 Chinese respondents and 4,958 Korean respondents aged 45–79. Results. The proportions of grandparents providing childcare to grandchildren differ considerably between China (58\%) and south Korea (6\%). still, the determinants of grandparents’ involvement in childcare (e.g., age, geographic proximity) are fairly similar in both countries. However, financial support from adult children to grandparents is found to be significant in China only, whereas Korean grandparents exhibit a greater propensity to care for their (employed) daughters’ children than for their sons’ children. Discussion. Our analysis suggests that in south Korea, patrilineal considerations may begin to lose some of their importance in shaping downward functional solidarity between generations and that instead (grand-)children’s actual needs, particularly those related to maternal employment, receive more attention. We find no such evidence in our Chinese sample.},

  abstract = {This comparative study addressed three open questions about the demography of grandparenthood in contemporary societies: First, at what age do people become grandparents? Second, how is grandparenthood sequenced with other transitions in later life? Third, how long is the grandparent life stage? To answer these questions, we analyzed retrospective data from the United States (NSFH) and 24 European countries (GGS, ESS, DEAS). Using survival methods, we estimated (1) age at grandparenthood; (2)~demographic overlap with parenting, worker, and filial roles; and (3) expected length of the grandparent life stage. Three central findings emerged from the analysis: First, the timing of grandparenthood varies strongly across countries. Cross-national differences in the median age at grandparenthood are larger than in age at parenthood, age at retirement, and life expectancy. Compared to the United States (49 years among women, 52~years among men), grandparenthood in Eastern Europe occurs up to three years earlier in life; in Western Europe, up to eight years later. Second, cross-national variation in the life-course context of grandparenthood is less pronounced. In all countries, grandparenthood overlaps rarely with active parenting but frequently with worker and filial roles. Third, the length of the grandparent life stage is more strongly influenced by the timing of fertility than by the timing of mortality. The longest years of life shared with grandchildren (35 years) are expected among grandmothers in East Germany and the United States; the shortest (21 years) among grandfathers in West Germany and Spain.},

  abstract = {Projected demographic changes in the U.S. will reduce the share of the working-age population. Analyses based on standard OLG models predict that these changes will increase the capital–labor ratio. Hence, rates of return to capital decrease and wages increase, which has adverse welfare consequences for current cohorts who will be retired when the rate of return is low. This paper argues that adding endogenous human capital accumulation to the standard model dampens these forces. We find that this adjustment channel is quantitatively important. The standard model with exogenous human capital predicts welfare losses up to 12.5\% (5.6\%) of lifetime consumption, when contribution (replacement) rates to the pension system are kept constant. These numbers reduce to approximately 8.7\% (4.4\%) when human capital can endogenously adjust.},

Parents with higher Social Security benefits provide more hours of help to children in the form of grandchild care, even though children significantly withdraw caregiving to parents along this dimension. Taken together, these results are consistent with parental altruism and have strong implications for the distributional consequences of Social Security reform.},

First, I argue that social security programs around the world link public pensions to retirement: people do not lose their pensions if they make a million dollars a year in the stock market, but they do confront marginal tax rates of up to 100 percent if they choose to work. Second, after arguing that most existing theories cannot explain this fact, I construct a positive theory that is consistent with it. The main idea is that pensions ate a means to induce retirement--that is, to buy the elderly out oftbe labor force because aggregate output is higher if the elderly do not work. This is modeled through positiveexternalities in the averagestock of human capital: because skills depreciate with age, the elderly have lower-than-average skill and, as a result, have a negative effect on the productivity of the young. When the difference between the skill level oftbe young and that of the old is large enough, aggregate output in an economy where the elderly do not work is higher. Retirement is desirable in this case, and social security transfers are the means by which such retirement is induced. The theory developed in this paper is also shown to be consistent with a number of other regularities documented in Section 1.},

  abstract = {Research on the choices of childcare arrangements in Italy shows the fundamental role of grandparents in providing informal childcare. Therefore, it is important to understand how grandparents provide different types of childcare, especially in terms of differences in their socio-economic, demographic and physical status, jointly with the characteristics of their grandchildren. Grandparents aged 50 and over with at least one non-co-resident grandchild aged 13 years or less were selected from the 2009 Italian household survey. Multilevel multinomial logistic regression models for grandmothers and grandfathers were used to identify the determinants of the probability of providing childcare intensively, occasionally or during school holidays rather than never. The probability of a grandparent providing intensive childcare is significantly reduced by being: male, unmarried, in bad health and with inadequate economic resources. Nevertheless, when analysing the probability of providing childcare occasionally or during holidays, the individual characteristics of grandparents and grandchildren are less significant compared to intensive childcare, meaning that grandparents provide non-intensive care regardless of their individual characteristics, and this is particularly true for grandmothers. Results confirm the fundamental importance of grandparents in providing informal childcare in Italy, and they offer useful information to understand the individual characteristics associated with different types of grandparental childcare.},

Also, it may cause faster growth than funded programs, especially when receipts from funded programs are independent of contributions.

This manual aims to enhance the users’ understanding and application of the survey data. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is a survey of the mid-aged and elderly in China, based on a sample of households with members aged 45 years or above. It attempts to set up a high quality public micro-database, which can provide a wide range of information from socio-economic status to health conditions, to serve the needs of scientific research on the mid-aged and elderly. CHARLS is based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and related aging surveys such as the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) and the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Considering the enormous complexity involved in a national survey, we began with a pilot survey in just two provinces in 2008: Gansu, a poor inland province, and Zhejiang, a rich coastal province. The pilot survey collected data from 95 communities/villages in 32 counties/districts, covering 2,685 individuals living in 1,570 households. The pilot survey produced a set of high quality survey data, demonstrated that fielding an HRS-type survey in China is feasible. Based on pilot survey experiences, CHARLS conducted its national baseline survey in 2011-2012. To ensure sample representativeness, CHARLS survey covered 150 countries/districts, 450 villages/urban communities, across the country. We successfully interviewed 17,708 individuals in 10,257 households, reflecting the Chinese mid-aged and elderly population collectively.},
