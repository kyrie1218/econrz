# HTML
## HTML file outline
A HTML file is a plain-text file with suffix of `.html`. Usually, it consists of three parts: **document type declaration**,  **header** and **body**.

## Elements
A HTML elment is a tag with some contents like:

```html
<tagname> Content here </tagname>

```

The first tag we should learn is doctype tag, which declares our document type to help browsers well display web pages. This tag should be put in the first line of HTML files. The detailed code is like this:

```html title="first.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
