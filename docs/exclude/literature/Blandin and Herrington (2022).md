!!! abstract "Summary"
    Blandin and Herrington (2022) extend Athreya and Elerly (2021) by endogenizing the distribution over preparedness over precollege investments to explain the variation of college completion. They think students' heterogeneity in the family background plays an important role to decide how they prepare for college as found in the pattern.
